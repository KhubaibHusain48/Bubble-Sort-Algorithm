# Bubble Sort Algorithm in Java

## Description

This project implements the **Bubble Sort** algorithm in Java to sort an integer array in ascending order. Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

## Features

* Sorts an integer array using Bubble Sort.
* Demonstrates nested loops for comparison and swapping.
* Prints the sorted array as output.

## Code Structure

* `BubbleSort` class with a `main` method implementing the sorting logic.

## How to Run

1. Compile the class:

   ```bash
   javac BubbleSort.java
   ```

2. Run the program:

   ```bash
   java BubbleSort
   ```

## Sample Output

```
12 23 34 65 78 98 
```

## Explanation

* The outer loop controls the number of passes.
* The inner loop compares adjacent elements and swaps them if necessary.
* After all passes, the array is sorted in ascending order.
* The sorted array is printed with spaces between elements.

## Requirements

* Java JDK 8 or above
* Basic understanding of arrays and loops in Java
